The  $1.5 trillion farm spending bill aims to align the farm safety net with the needs of producers, make long-term investment in locally led, voluntary, incentive-based conservation practices, expand market access and trade promotion opportunities, strengthen program operations to demand transparency and accountability to the taxpayer, and revitalize rural communities and economies.\n\n\nThe full text of the Farm Bill, as well as a title by title summary, and other resources, can be found [[here https://agriculture.house.gov/farmbill/]]","Support":"Industry and Stakeholder supporters include the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, US Dairy Export Council, Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities, American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean Association, National Alliance of Forest Owners, and the Conservation Fund. \n\n[[Full list of supporters https://agriculture.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=7765]]","Farm Bill Status":"The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Agriculture completed its markup of the Farm Bill on May 24, 2024. The proposed legislation passed out of committee, with a 33-21 vote (with all Republicans and four Democrats voting 'yes'). The bill now awaits \"floor time,\" where it can be voted on by the entire House of Representatives.","Analysis":"The Farm, Food, and National Security Act reauthorizes the 2018 Agriculture Improvement Act. Below is a brief analysis of the twelve titles within the legislation, particularly focused on how they impact soil health, regenerative agriculture, and sustainability. \n\n1. Commodities: The House Farm Bill increases the commodity payments for farmers under the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) programs by adding 10% to 20% to the statutory reference prices to various crops covered in the commodity title. The House bill also expands base acres and expands eligibility for assistance for standing disaster programs. \n\nThese provisions provide a strong safety net for farmers who have adopted soil health practices, however, even with these changes, the commodity support is not accessible to many small and medium-sized farmers. There is broad concern that the funding increases in this title are not adequately paid for by funding cuts elsewhere in the Farm Bill. \n\n2. Conservation: Title II of the House Farm Bill reallocates IRA funds to conservation programs like EQIP, CSP, and RCPP and enhances EQIP with precision agriculture technologies and innovative practices but removes the climate sideboards for IRA funding. The bill modifies the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to incentivize marginal land enrollment and creates a matching grant program for states and tribes to improve soil health. It also streamlines program implementation, updates watershed programs, and emphasizes science, technology, and innovation in conservation practices and programs. \n\nBringing IRA funding into the Farm Bill will significantly increase base line conservation funding for future years, but removing the climate side bars could cause a majority of the funding go to a few select practices and a small number of farmers. While there are several common sense improvements to conservation programs and technical assistance support, the House Farm Bill also proposes some changes, such as priorities for the Conservation Reserve Program, that could have negative consequences on soil health and conservation. \n\n3. Trade: Title III of the House Farm Bill focuses on enhancing U.S. agricultural trade by doubling funding for the Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market Development (FMD) program, aiming to mitigate global food insecurity and provide new markets for U.S. producers. It prioritizes U.S. commodities in food aid, balances the roles of USAID and USDA, addresses trade barriers and infrastructure deficiencies, and fosters international agricultural education partnerships to support global economic growth and innovation.\n\nAccess to domestic and international markets is critical for all farmers, including those using regenerative and soil health promoting practices. \n\n4. Nutrition: Title IV of the House Farm Bill increases funding for Community Food Projects, food banks, and various nutrition assistance programs, including those for seniors and tribal communities. The bill enhances SNAP by ensuring college students and young workers retain eligibility and allows states more flexibility in program implementation. It also addresses program integrity, requiring USDA to act on the National Accuracy Clearinghouse and establishing an office of program integrity within FNS. Additionally, the bill mandates updates to the Thrifty Food Plan and reforms the Dietary Guidelines for Americans process to prioritize science and transparency. \n\nBecause this title also mandates that future Thrifty Food Plan updates are kept budget neutral, seen as a future cut to nutrition assistance, the title lacks the bipartisan support needed to move forward. \n\n5. Credit: Title V of the House Farm Bill enhances financing options for producers who cannot obtain commercial credit, updating loan limits and expanding the EZGuarantee Loan Program for faster approval times. It supports new, young, beginning, and veteran farmers by reducing experience requirements, streamlining entity structures for farm transitions, and reauthorizing programs like the Heirs Property Relending Program. The bill also protects and enhances the ability of commercial lenders to provide credit and capital to rural America, including expanding access to the secondary market for certain loans and allowing Farm Credit institutions to partner with community banks.\n\nWhile the credit title does not directly mention support for producers adopting soil health and regenerative practices, the expanded support for new, young, and beginning farmers may help many small and medium-sized producers have access to financing resources they may not otherwise be able to obtain from commercial creditors. \n\n6. Rural Development: Title VI of the House Farm Bill strengthens broadband connectivity through the newly integrated ReConnect Rural Broadband Program, raises minimum eligibility speeds, and provides funding for infrastructure improvements. The bill also enhances precision agriculture practices, improves access to healthcare, supports rural childcare initiatives, and addresses workforce challenges by reauthorizing and modifying key programs. Additionally, it encourages private capital investment and streamlines the permitting process for rural development projects.\n\nMany farmers rely on rural infrastructure to support their livelihoods, incomes, and farming operations. The rural development title expands critical resources for rural communities. \n\n7. Research, Extension and Related Matters: Title VII of the House Farm Bill provides at least $1 billion for modernizing agricultural research facilities, increases funding for the Specialty Crop Research Initiative, and allocates resources for mechanization and automation technologies in the specialty crop industry. Additionally, it supports scholarships for students at 1890 institutions, promotes interagency coordination for agricultural research, and reauthorizes various capacity and competitive funding programs to address current agricultural industry needs.\n\nThe House Farm Bill adds a ‘Soil Health Research Initiative’ to the list of high-priority research and extension initiatives. \n\n8. Forestry: Title VIII of the House Farm Bill expands public-private partnerships, enhances forest product markets, supports innovative wood products, and improves rural housing and community health through flexible funding and streamlined environmental processes. \n\nBiochar has been shown to have some soil health promoting properties. The bill authorizes a biochar application demonstration project to facilitate the use of biochar, develop new biochar applications, and support its commercialization. Additionally, the bill reauthorizes and enhances the Community Wood Facilities Grant Program to include biochar, increasing the maximum grant for projects and expanding federal cost-share. These initiatives aim to leverage biochar for improving forest health and creating new market opportunities.\n\n9. Energy: Title IX of the House Farm Bill increases access to energy system and efficiency updates for farmers, ranchers, and rural small businesses while promoting growth and innovation in biofuels, bioproducts, and related feedstocks. It enhances the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) by increasing loan guarantees and federal cost-share, streamlines biobased market and biofuel program delivery, and addresses concerns about converting private forestland and prime farmland into solar panel installations.\n\nBioenergy production can provide a valuable market for agricultural products but can also promote mono-cropping and reduce rotational diversity.\n\n10. Horticulture, Marketing and Regulatory Reform: Title X of the House Farm Bill makes critical investments to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops and protect plant health while delivering regulatory reforms to ease the burden on American farmers and ranchers. It increases funding for the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program and the Plant Pest and Disease Management Program, and it continues support for organic production through various initiatives. Additionally, the bill maintains funding for the Local Agriculture Market Program, improves program delivery, and expands the responsibilities of the Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production.\n\nMany of the programs supported by this title are critical for assuring that small and medium-sized farmers, urban farmers, and new and beginning farmers can market their products and have access to technical assistance needed to be successful. \n\n11. Crop Insurance: Title XI of the House Farm Bill expands premium assistance for beginning and veteran farmers, directs research and development for new policies, and establishes a specialty crop advisory committee to ensure specialty crop producers are represented in policy development. Additionally, it enhances certain coverage options, increases premium support for Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO), and bolsters the private sector delivery system by increasing funding for compliance activities and adjusting administrative expenses.\n\nThe bill makes progress to protect taxpayer interests by expanding research on the actuarial soundness of crop insurance policies while maintaining the farm safety net. The bill does not take steps towards accounting for the risk-reducing benefits of soil health practices or removing disincentives currently existing in crop insurance that prevent some farmers from adopting soil health practices.  \n\n12. Miscellaneous: Title XII of the House Farm Bill allocates $233 million annually to protect the livestock and poultry industry from catastrophic foreign animal diseases. It directs reviews of the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program and establishes a dog detection training center to safeguard against invasive pests and diseases. The bill also negotiates animal disease regionalization agreements, mandates electronic documentation for importing live dogs, and reauthorizes the Sheep Production and Marketing Grant Program. Additionally, it enhances protection for dogs under the Animal Welfare Act, supports small meat processing facilities, and addresses food and agriculture sector vulnerabilities.\n\nProvisions supporting small meat processing facilities can help farmers integrating livestock to promote soil health to have access to processing.

By creating a grant program that gives economic opportunities to these producers to expand their markets, they have more opportunity to grow their profits which could help fund the addition of soil health practices on their operations. \n\nThe funding would be delivered through a combination of cooperative agreements issued by the Secretary to eligible state or tribal governments (who first would apply for funding), while projects made possible by the grants would be run by \"collaborators,\" including private, for-profit or non-profit entities, in partnership with a state or tribal government.\n\nEmphasis is placed on purchasing food from small, beginning, or underserved farmers, ranchers, and fishers, and distributing food purchased to historically underserved communities. Up to 25% of funds are to be spent on administration and technical assistance (of which no less than 50% should be spent on technical assistance) including to support participating producers; efforts to grow the local agricultural value chain; and small, beginning, veteran, and underserved farmers in obtaining food safety training and certifications.\n\nThe bill authorizes $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2024 and each fiscal year thereafter of mandatory funding, drawn from the Commodity Credit Corporation.","Introduced":"2024-03-20T07:00:00.000Z","Last Action":"2024-03-20T07:00:00.000Z","Sponsor":"Sen.

The bill also allows contributions of non-Federal funds for public marketing and education on biobased products. The Secretary is instructed to use industry-standard methods for determining the contents of biobased products.\n\nAdditionally, the bill establishes a Biobased Task Force within the Department of Agriculture, tasked with coordinating programs related to biobased products, maximizing resources, assessing program effectiveness, and making recommendations for improvements.

However, the current process to create a new NRCS conservation practice standard (CPS) is often slow and bureaucratic.\n\nMany farmers and researchers are unable to participate in the process of introducing new or updating existing CPS. This can create a gap between best practices and emerging research and innovation, and national availability through NRCS, resulting in outdated or incomplete guidance being used in the field.\n\nBy collecting public input on new and existing standards, and increasing flexibility to update practices on a rolling basis, NRCS can improve the consistency of available support across the country and adopt new approaches in a way that is faster and more accessible, yet still scientifically rigorous and locally-led, bridging the gap between research and practice to better serve farmers’ needs and get funding into farmers’ hands faster.","Introduced":"2023-07-27T07:00:00.000Z","Last Action":"2023-07-27T07:00:00.000Z","Sponsor":"Sen.

The bill intends to expand the role of the Department of Agriculture in promoting biobased products and increase federal purchasing of such products. It also emphasizes strengthening domestic manufacturing and making a national commitment to rural and agricultural economies.\n\nKey provisions of the bill include amending Section 9002 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act to update procurement requirements for biobased products, establish price premiums, and require reporting on noncompliance. The bill also allows contributions of non-Federal funds for public marketing and education on biobased products. The Secretary is instructed to use industry-standard methods for determining the contents of biobased products.\n\nAdditionally, the bill establishes a Biobased Task Force within the Department of Agriculture, tasked with coordinating programs related to biobased products, maximizing resources, assessing program effectiveness, and making recommendations for improvements.

This could result in extending a new pot of funding to entities that are currently ineligible for conservation funding under USDA. The list of entities is sufficiently broad that it is unclear how much of the funding would actually reach farmers.\n\nThe funding could be directed towards existing, well-developed programs, such as the Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) program, which already have broad conservation mandates.\n\nWhile limited details are provided with respect to the Pyrolysis Program, it appears to be geared towards creating opportunities for nut producers to monetize current byproducts.\n\nIdentical as last version of bill.
