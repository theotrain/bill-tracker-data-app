The contract library would be permanently authorized and specify key details about the contents that must be included in the library – like the duration and other provisions in the contract that may impact price such as schedules, premiums, discounts, and transportation arrangements.\n\nMandate that each regional mandatory minimum be not less than the average of that region’s negotiated trade for the two year period of 2020-2021.

In order to have robust price discovery that provides accurate information about market dynamics along the supply chain, you need a competitive cash\nmarket with multiple price discovery points. Negotiated trade, also called the “cash” or “spot” market increasingly has been replaced by formula pricing, forward contracts, and longer-term marketing agreements—collectively referred to as “alternative marketing\narrangements” (AMAs).\n\nNegotiated transactions involve a bid and ask process. The negotiated market facilitates price discovery, which is the process of establishing the “going rate” of cattle based on market conditions at any given time. Formula pricing, where a reference price from a published report is used as the base price for the transaction, is becoming more common. The bulk of formula pricing uses negotiated cash prices as the base in the formula— meaning information from the negotiated cash market is being heavily leveraged by nonparticipants, even as negotiated purchases decline in volume. \n\nIf a packer relies on the negotiated market to set the price for a large portion of the cattle they purchase, they should actively participate in establishing the negotiated price.\"\n\nSens.

Approved pricing mechanisms are fed cattle purchases made through negotiated cash, negotiated grid, at a stockyard and through trading systems that multiple buyers and sellers regularly can make and accept bids.\n\nRequire USDA to set minimum levels of purchases through approved pricing mechanisms that covered packers – those controlling five percent of more of fed cattle slaughter – must make.\n\nInclude provisions to create a publicly available \"cattle contract library\" of marketing contracts, mandating boxed beef reporting to ensure transparency, expediting the reporting of cattle carcass weights, and requiring a packer to report the number of cattle scheduled to be delivered for slaughter each day for the next 14 days. The contract library would be permanently authorized and specify key details about the contents that must be included in the library – like the duration and other provisions in the contract that may impact price such as schedules, premiums, discounts, and transportation arrangements.\n\nMandate that each regional mandatory minimum be not less than the average of that region’s negotiated trade for the two year period of 2020-2021. Additionally, sets a maximum threshold for any region at 50 percent. Require USDA to conduct an initial review of mandatory minimums after two years.

In order to have robust price discovery that provides accurate information about market dynamics along the supply chain, you need a competitive cash\nmarket with multiple price discovery points. Negotiated trade, also called the “cash” or “spot” market increasingly has been replaced by formula pricing, forward contracts, and longer-term marketing agreements—collectively referred to as “alternative marketing\narrangements” (AMAs).\n\nNegotiated transactions involve a bid and ask process. The negotiated market facilitates price discovery, which is the process of establishing the “going rate” of cattle based on market conditions at any given time. Formula pricing, where a reference price from a published report is used as the base price for the transaction, is becoming more common. The bulk of formula pricing uses negotiated cash prices as the base in the formula— meaning information from the negotiated cash market is being heavily leveraged by nonparticipants, even as negotiated purchases decline in volume. \n\nIf a packer relies on the negotiated market to set the price for a large portion of the cattle they purchase, they should actively participate in establishing the negotiated price.\"\n\nSens. Fischer, Wyden, Grassley, and Tester introduced the [[Cattle Price Discovery and Transparency Act https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news?ID=ED39FFA4-8F1D-4211-80F9-1B4F3EBD11CA]] in March 2022.

Strengthening the safety net for small cattle ranchers, as follows: Increase the premium subsidy within the Livestock Risk Protection insurance program (LRP) for ranchers who market 100 or less head of cattle per year; Create the Beef Cattle Spread Coverage Program, an indemnity program administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) that provides relief to small producers when the farmer’s share of the retail dollar drops below 51.7 percent; and Provide resources to RMA and FSA to educate producers and insurance agents on the utility of the livestock insurance programs and the safety net program.\n\n2. Increase competition and market access for small cattle ranchers, as follows: Create a Small Rancher Market Access competitive grant program. Administered by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), this program will help small producers, cooperatives of small producers, or other eligible organizations aggregate, add value, and market meat and meat products to local and regional markets with a focus on direct-to-consumer and direct-to-institution sales; and Provide AMS with resources to educate farmers on how to best apply for and leverage these new programs.","Support":"[[Press Release https://davidscott.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=399771]]","Farm Bill Status":"","Analysis":"Lack of access to local markets for small and regenerative producers prevents the opportunity to increase net farm or ranch profitability and keep more food dollars inside local economies. Increasing access could also allow more farmers to integrate regeneratively managed livestock into their cropping systems.

This could support the economic viability of regenerative producers.\n\nEligible entities for the \"Small Rancher Market Access\" program would include groups of small cattle producers (average of 100 head or fewer) cooperatives with a majority of members under a certain size, non-profits or Land Grant Universities with experience working with small sized cattle producers, Tribal governments, food hubs, or CSAs.

While the bill provides a 90% taxpayer-funded cost-share to encourage the adoption of these practices, it lacks clear standards or guidelines that would ensure significant reductions in input costs. Additionally, the legislation does not provide any additional funding, so the expanded cost-share could draw directly from existing resources and strain conservation program budgets for other proven soil health practices with well-documented input reduction benefits to farmers and ranchers.\n\nThe bill also addresses glyphosate regulation, prohibiting states from labeling glyphosate or glyphosate-containing products as carcinogens. This provision may be seen as protecting the agricultural industry from inconsistent state regulations, but it also undermines states' rights. It also openly endorses the safety and efficacy of glyphosate, which may not align with the free market values of many of the bill’s supporters.\n\nSection 5 of the bill requires the EPA to permit the continued sale and use of any pesticide, including those deemed harmful, for at least five years after suspension, cancellation, or a court order. While this provision may provide stability to the industry, it could also expose farmers and their communities to potential health risks.\n\nThe bill authorizes the EPA to use phosphogypsum, a low-level radioactive waste material (generated from fertilizer production), in government road construction projects. This helps repurpose waste material but may also raise environmental and health concerns.\n\nAdditionally, the bill modifies corporate emissions reporting requirements for the Securities and Exchange Commission, potentially limiting emissions-related data availability and quality. Moreover, the legislation includes elements related to meat and poultry processing, allowing establishments to operate at rates exceeding the maximum limits currently outlined in regulations.","Introduced":"2022-06-15T07:00:00.000Z","Last Action":"2022-06-16T07:00:00.000Z","Sponsor":"Rep.

Among the responsibilities of the Policy Committee would be to provide a final report of findings and recommendations for administrative and legislative action to Congress and the President within 180 days after the Conference adjourns.\n\nThe Conference would be charged with identifying viable solutions for ending hunger in the United States by 2030, reducing by 1⁄2 the level of nutrition insecurity by 2025, and reducing by 1⁄2 the level of diet-related illnesses by 2030; as well as reviewing \"the economic opportunities for independent farmers and ranchers to provide healthy food to their communities\"; among other purposes. \n\nThe bill authorizes $2.5 million annually for each of the fiscal years during which the Conference is planned and held.","Support":"The bill is supported by the Academy Of Nutrition and Dietetics, American Sustainable Business Council, Center for Food Safety, Earthjustice, Fair Food Network, Farm Aid, Foodshed Alliance, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, National Farm to School Network, National Farmers Union, National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, National Young Farmers Coalition, Rural Coalition, Slow Food USA, and Tufts University, among others (view full list of endorsing organizations [[here https://www.booker.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wh_list.pdf]]).\n\nBooker [[Press Release https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-braun-mcgovern-and-walorski-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-bill-that-would-convene-a-white-house-conference-on-food-nutrition-hunger-and-health]]","Farm Bill Status":"","Analysis":"The first such conference was held in 1969 under President Nixon, and culminated in the creation and expansion of programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and the National School Breakfast and Lunch Program. \n\nThe proposed second conference would \"take a whole-of-government approach to ending hunger and combatting nutrition insecurity in America, featuring diverse voices and those with lived experience.

Recommendations would likely interact with and inform the provisions of the 2023 Farm Bill. The effectiveness of recommendations made as a result of the Conference would depend on robust funding commitments being attached to them.","Introduced":"2021-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","Last Action":"2021-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","Sponsor":"Sen.

This bill provides for reconciliation pursuant to S. Con. Res. 14, a budget resolution which sets forth the congressional budget for the United States Government for FY2022 and sets forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2023 through 2031.\n\nThis budget framework, introduced by Senate Democrats, proposes $1.75 trillion in new spending to enact the \"Build Back Better\" agenda, including a total of $89.44 billion for agriculture.\n\nHouse Democrats on 11/3 unveiled [[new legislative text https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-117HR5376RH-RCP117-18.pdf]] for the package, which includes $28.29 billion for conservation programs (slightly higher than the original $28B). According to Politico: \"Climate-related farm and forestry programs still make up the bulk of ag money in the bill, including programs that incentivize farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to adopt emissions-mitigating practices.\"\n\nSee House Agriculture Committee [[fact sheet https://agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/house_agriculture_build_back_better_act_provisions_.pdf]] on the ag provisions in the bill.\n\nNOTE: This bill was reintroduced and passed as the Inflation Reduction Act (see passed tab). ","Support":"See \"[[Reconciliation Tracker https://www.crfb.org/blogs/fy-2022-reconciliation-tracker]]\"","Farm Bill Status":"","Analysis":"This bill allocates a total of $89.44 billion to agriculture, which includes the $28.29 billion for conservation, as well as $2 billion for ag research, $18 billion for rural investment, $27.15 billion for forestry programs, and $12 billion in debt relief for farmers.\n\nThe $28.29 billion for conservation programs nearly doubles current funding levels, paralleling asks from a broad coalition of farming, food, ag business and nonprofit organizations. Conservation programs currently receive about $6 billion per year for the current five-year cycle (or $30 billion). This investment would significantly expand access to the currently oversubscribed conservation programs such as CSP and EQIP. Democrats have touted the amount as \"the largest investment in conservation since the Dust Bowl.\" That these provisions were not cut, when many others were, reflects a relatively new understanding by policymakers of the huge role ag and forestry will play in reaching our emissions reductions goals.\n\nThe same broad coalition is pushing for a doubling of funding for training and technical support to help producers transition to a more resilient agriculture. The current addition of $200 million for conservation technical assistance (CTA) falls well short of doubling technical assistance, netting in at under 1/3 of the current $734 million annual CTA budget.\n\nThe bill has been held up by ongoing Democrat negotiations over the total cost and contents, since its passage requires support from every Democratic Senator. Groups are pushing for the passage of the bill with the full provisions for conservation (see Land Core's blog memo). They are joined by Congressional leaders, such as Reps. Pingree and Spanberger, who sent a letter on 10/18 urging Democratic leadership to keep $28 billion for conservation in the bill. \n\nThe Build Back Better Act passed in the House on November 19. Was stalled in the Senate. Reintroduced and passed as the Inflation Reduction Act (See Passed tab).","Introduced":"2021-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","Last Action":"2021-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","Sponsor":"Rep.

This 8/9 memo to Senators (from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office) instructed the Senate Agriculture Committee to focus on: Agriculture conservation, drought, and forestry programs to help reduce carbon emissions and prevent wildfires; rural development and rural co-op clean energy investments; agricultural climate research and research infrastructure; Civilian Climate Corps funding; child nutrition; and debt relief. The resolution also allows for additional new budget authority for wildfire suppression activities.\n\nA broad coalition of farming, food, ag business and nonprofit organizations called on Congress to use these funds to double the investment in USDA conservation programs and double technical assistance funding to help producers build a soil health. Conservation programs currently receive about $6 billion per year for the current five-year cycle (or $30 billion), which still leaves many of the most needed programs - like EQIP and CSP - oversubscribed, and USDA woefully understaffed to help with technical assistance and training. Doubling the conservation budget would provide critical access to these programs as well as the needed training and support to help producers transition a more resilient agriculture.\n\nThe House Agriculture Committee held a two-part markup session (9/10 and 9/13) to review the specific legislation that will determine how this funding is structured. See the bill text and amendments related to these markup sessions here. The committee approved nearly $66 billion in funding for agricultural research, rural investment and forestry programs (see a breakdown of this funding here). In advance of the House Budget Committee's Sept. 25 markup of the $3.5 trillion package, the committee released draft text of the bill, and Democrats are circulating a $28 billion plan to expand existing farm blll conservation programs.\n\nHouse and Senate Democrats are working to hammer out the package’s details this week and get it to the House for a possible vote by Sept. 27.\n\nThe agreement calls for the $3.5 trillion in long-term investments to be fully offset by a combination of new tax revenues, health care savings, and long-term economic growth.\"","Introduced":"2021-08-09T07:00:00.000Z","Last Action":"2021-08-24T07:00:00.000Z","Sponsor":"Sen.

This goal would be pursued through establishing a USDA Greenhouse Gas Technical Assistance Provider and Third-Party Verifier Certification Program for carbon credits, through which USDA would be able to centralize information and provide \"transparency, legitimacy, and informal endorsement\" of third-party verifiers and technical service providers that help private landowners generate carbon credits through a variety of agriculture and forestry related practices.\n\nNew sections in this version of the act include: Sec. 2(d)(2) adds eligible activities including livestock emissions reductions through manure management practices, avoidance of the conversion of wetlands and grasslands in addition to forests, the restoration of wetlands and grasslands, and \"current practices associated with private land conservation programs administered by the Secretary\" (though these are not outlined); Sec. 2(e) includes a new \"Fair Treatment of Farmers\" section, which would require USDA to ensure technical assistance providers and credit verifiers provide farmers with realistic cost and revenue estimates, and help farmers, ranchers and foresters to “receive fair distribution\" of the revenue derived from the sale of carbon credits (reflecting negotiations and concerns over the original version of the bill); Sec. 2(g)(2) stipulates the composition of the advisory council be not less than 51% farmers, ranchers, or private forest owners, including socially disadvantaged or historically underserved farmers and ranchers.

The only requierment is under Sec. 2(a)(5), which requires demonstration projects to derive at least 50 percent of the feedstock required to produce biochar from forest thinning and management; note, the other 50% can be derived from any source. \n\nPer Sec. 2(a)(3), proposals for demonstration projects would be given priority based on carbon sequestration potential, but also potential for job creation, market viability of the projects, and local need.

Currently, public lands and resources are vulnerable to mining and a lack of cleanup (polluting waters) by these mining companies. \n\nThese are procedures to be added to the public lands mining permitting processes that take reclamation into account: \"(b) Operation And Reclamation Standards.—The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall jointly promulgate regulations that establish operation and reclamation standards for mineral activities permitted under this Act.

The Secretaries may determine whether outcome-based performance standards or technology-based design standards are most appropriate.\"\n\nIn the same section, 307(b)(1) further explains that the regulations shall address the \"Segregation, protection, and replacement of topsoil or other suitable growth medium, and the prevention, where possible, of soil contamination.\" 307(b)(3) states that the regulations should also address the control of sediments to prevent erosion and manage drainage.
